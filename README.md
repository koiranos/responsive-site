## Introduction

The website has developed with React and [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for the front-end part, and [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) for the back-end.

The website consists of a page view area that contains all the activated pages and an admin panel that controls the **creation**, **manipulation**, and **deletion** of each page.

All the requests between the front and back-end are held by [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) client, and those for the back-end and the API, with [node-fetch](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch). 

The styling of the page is done with [Reactstrap](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap).
